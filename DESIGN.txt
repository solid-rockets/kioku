The basic idea is to develop/test out basic logic with console + tkinter,
but that eventually will be replaced to a large extent with a web interface.
The plan is to setup this program on a server (local, or cloud, etc.) and
allow multiple users to connect to it.

Main scripts:
1. test - for testing myself with flashcards. Default is 50 of worst score, newer first, correct once.
2. insert - for transferring new words from a CSV-like format to JSON.
3. reset - for resetting the weights (scores) of all words.

Side scripts:
4. dict2lines.py - transform gjiten format entries into kioku format lines.
5. check4doubles.py - checks lines for doubles.

Input format of flashcard:
<front>:<back>:<score>
...

[DEPRECATED] Output format of a flashcard (JSON):
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "front": "<front>",
      "back": "<back>",
      "score": 0
    },
    ...
}
